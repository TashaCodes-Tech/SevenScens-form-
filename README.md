# 📮 Feedback Form (HTML Project)

This is a simple **HTML feedback form** I built to practice creating user input sections and understanding form structure.

## 📌 About

This project includes:
- Text input fields (e.g. Name, Email)
- A dropdown or radio buttons for rating
- A comment or suggestion textarea
- A submit button (non-functional — no backend yet!)

It’s a clean, beginner-friendly form that could easily be expanded in the future with CSS styling or backend functionality.
